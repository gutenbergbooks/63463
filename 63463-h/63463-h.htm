  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The first three stories contained in the book found
great favor with the reading public, having been published
in the Woman’s Home Companion.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the stories are wholesome and have good influence
upon the little readers. In Danny Do-Little,
work is made delightful through play. In Old Mother
Bear’s Christmas Stocking, the selfishness of the animals
is dwelt upon, but also their kindness of heart,
and the saying brought out that, “One good turn
deserves another.” The little Birthday story will be
interesting to read at school and children’s parties, for
who among the little ones does not occasionally have a
birthday?</p>

<p class='c009'>Catchy little jingles run throughout the stories.
An enthusiastic parent in Massachusetts said: “My
children are very much pleased with Laura Rountree
Smith’s Jingle Books, and must have a story before
bed-time each night. I think her books mighty clever.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The book contains stories which can easily be read
by the children themselves.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>The Gingerbread Boy</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Polly and Peter had to stay home
one Saturday when mother was ill.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mother said, “Polly, take my place
in the kitchen, please, and, Peter, you
must amuse the baby.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Polly went down stairs, put on her
little all-over apron, and sat down on
the kitchen stool.</p>

<p class='c009'>She sighed: “Oh dear, something
always happens on a sunny Saturday—when
I want to play! We have to
miss the school picnic to-day; but I
will smile, and smile, and something
nice will surely happen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>With that, the dimples began to
play hide and seek upon her face, and
she heard an airy, fairy voice calling:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Little Fairy Help-You-Out,</div>
      <div class='line'>Blithe and gay beyond a doubt,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll introduce you with much joy,</div>
      <div class='line'>To the dear little, queer little Gingerbread Boy!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Who are you?” cried Polly.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>She looked high and low, but no one
was to be seen.</p>

<p class='c009'>Polly smiled again, and said: “I
have a new apron that I was going to
wear to the picnic.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The better to cook with my dear,”
said a sugary voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Polly looked about, but could not
see the Gingerbread Boy, though she
felt sure he had spoken.</p>

<p class='c009'>Polly said: “I will make some gingerbread
cookies, and see what comes
of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Polly mixed the cookies a sugary
voice cried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“More sugar, more spice,</div>
      <div class='line'>Make everything nice.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span><i>Then the most wonderful thing happened!</i></p>

<p class='c009'>The little rolling-pin that Polly was
using turned to gold; and how it did
roll out those gingerbread cookies!
Then the cutter turned to gold, and cut
them out into queer shapes and sizes.</p>

<p class='c009'>The currants jumped upon the cookies
making funny faces upon them.</p>

<p class='c009'>They leaped into the pans, and all
Polly had to do was to set them into
the oven to bake.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was so happy, she swept the
kitchen and washed the dishes, and
would have forgotten the cookies, I am
sure, if she had not heard a voice calling:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“Try to think what you’re about,</div>
      <div class='line'>Better take the cookies out;</div>
      <div class='line'>Someone’s tapping at the door</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the oven, as before!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Sure enough, Polly heard a rapping,
tapping, and when she opened the oven
door she heard the cookies call in a
happy chorus:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We’re brown and pretty as any toy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hurrah, hurrah for the Gingerbread Boy!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>As Polly took the cookies out of the
pan, she saw one was shaped like a
regular boy, and before she could say
a word, out he jumped and sat down
on the ice box, fanning himself with a
geranium leaf.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>Polly said, “I must go and call Peter.
I must introduce him to the Gingerbread
Boy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Peter had been thinking about the
picnic, but he tried to amuse the baby
by playing ball, and at this very minute
in came Polly to tell about the
Gingerbread Boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>To their surprise the Gingerbread
Boy said,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If you will eat my hands and feet</div>
      <div class='line'>You’ll find you’ve something very sweet.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, oh,” cried the children, “It
would not be polite to eat you!” But
all this time they crept nearer and
nearer.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>The Gingerbread Boy said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Come, nibble my fingers; come nibble my toes!</div>
      <div class='line'>I can run—that’s the way the Fairy Tale goes!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Peter nibbled the toes and Polly
nibbled the fingers, while the baby
stood by and clapped his hands with
delight.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Gingerbread Boy said;</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Molasses is used to sweeten, sweeten,</div>
      <div class='line'>I was made to be eaten, eaten!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The children nibbled away until only
the Gingerbread Boy’s voice was left,
but he sang gaily:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To be happy and good I try,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dear boys and girls, good bye, good bye.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>So he was <i>all gone</i>!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>All this time the gingerbread cookies
looked out of their large currant eyes,
and Fairy Help-You-Out came into the
kitchen and whispered into Polly’s ear
and Peter’s ear and the baby’s ear
something about a picnic.</p>

<p class='c009'>The children clapped their hands
with delight as three little baskets sailed
down on the kitchen floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>Each basket was full of good things
to eat, and the baby’s basket had a
bottle of milk in it, of course!</p>

<p class='c009'>They were having the finest kind of
a picnic right at home, in their own
kitchen, when a voice called:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I would like to come—I don’t wish to annoy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Have you any room for the Gingerbread Boy?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><i>Three Little Baskets Sailed Down on the Kitchen Floor</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>The children rubbed their eyes to
see if they were awake, and the Gingerbread
Boy jumped in the window and
sat on the ice box, fanning himself with
a nasturtium leaf.</p>

<p class='c009'>He laughed until his sides shook,
saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Don’t wake your mother, don’t make a noise,</div>
      <div class='line'>The woods are full of Gingerbread Boys.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Fairy Help-You-Out faded away, because
she was no longer needed. For
all I know, the Gingerbread Boy is
with the children yet.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>The Easter Bunny</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Mother Tiny-Tail sat in her little

      <div class='line'>“Alas! alack! I am old and gray,</div>

<p><i>He Went to the Little Brown Hen Who Lives in the Lane</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Just then a Funny Bunny came by
with a hop, and a skip, and a bound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>and said, “Oh, Mother Tiny-Tail, no
eggs for Easter, no eggs for the Tiny-Tails?
That will never do!” So saying,
he borrowed Mother Tiny-Tail’s
market basket, and went hippety-hop
to the Little Brown Hen who lives in
the lane, saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Please give me eggs now that I ask it,</div>
      <div class='line'>Enough to fill my market basket.”</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Little Brown Hen said:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then Funny Bunny went with a hop,
and a skip, and a jump to the little old
Farmer who lived in the field and said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Please give me corn, now that I ask it,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>The Farmer replied:</p>

<p><i>Please Give Me Corn</i></p>

<p class='c009'>Funny Bunny went with a pitter,
patter, pitter, patter, until he came to
the Miller, and said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Please give me a meal-bag, since I ask it,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Miller laughed until his old fat
sides shook and answered:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Your request sounds rather funny,</div>
      <div class='line'>I will give you meal for money.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Then Funny Bunny sat down on a
stone to think.</p>

<p class='c009'>How was he going to get some
money?</p>

<p class='c009'>It was getting dark, and the Little
Hill Men came out one by one, digging
for fairy gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Funny Bunny saw them he
cried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Please give me money, since I ask it,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Now, the Little Hill Men did not
want to give something for nothing, so
they shouted:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“With a hop, skip, bound, measure our hill</div>
      <div class='line'>And your empty basket we soon will fill.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Of course, the Little Hill Men never
dreamed that he would do it, so they
went on digging for fairy gold.</p>

<p class='c009'>Funny Bunny was in real earnest,
for he thought of Mother Tiny-Tail
rocking sadly to and fro in her red
plush rocking chair, so</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>From the daisies to the apple tree,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>My! how fast his legs could carry
him!</p>

<p class='c009'>He came back singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Your hill’s as long, your hill’s as wide</div>
      <div class='line'>As anyone would care to ride!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Little Hill Men were so surprised
he had answered their question
that they all stopped digging and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>crowded around Funny Bunny. “Click,
click, click,” they dropped gold into
his market basket.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he ran with a hop, skip and
jump to the Miller and bought a bag
of meal. He took the meal to the
Farmer and bought the corn. Then
he took the corn to the Little Brown
Hen, who lived in the lane, and she
counted out one dozen, two dozen,
three dozen, four dozen, five dozen
beautiful white eggs. They filled the
market basket Funny Bunny was
carrying.</p>

<p class='c009'>When he got home he set the market
basket down in front of Mother Tiny
Tail, saying:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Mother Tiny-Tail stopped rocking
to and fro; but before she could say,
“Thank you,” Funny Bunny was hippety-hoppety,
off and away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mother Tiny-Tail painted the
Easter eggs and hid them everywhere.</p>

<p class='c009'>On Easter morning, all the Tiny-Tails
cried, “Oh” and “Ah,” for they
found the Easter Eggs in their shoes,
in their oatmeal bowls, and in the most
unexpected places.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just at that very minute Funny
Bunny peeped in the window and cried,
as he held up a wonderful sugary egg:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Kindness comes back now and then,</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Funny Bunny was always so kind

<p class='c009'>Then, with a twinkle of nose, and a

hippety-hoppety, off and away, singing:</p>

<p class='c008'>Old Woman Work-Away was always
spinning. In the fall of the year she
began to think about Thanksgiving,
singing:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Just as she was thinking about her
Thanksgiving dinner, “Rap, a, tap,”
sounded on the door, and in came
Tinkle Bell, the fairy elf. The little

<p class='c009'>Out came a pile of fairy gold. He
went off with the woven cloth and the

<p class='c009'>The Old Woman was thinking now
she had money enough to buy cranberries
for Thanksgiving dinner, when
“Rap, a, tap” was heard on the door,

all her fairy gold, and sent him home
with a bag full so he could buy a
winter coat.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>The Old Woman went back to her

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>She soon had a pretty mat woven,

plum pudding for Thanksgiving dinner,
when, “Rap, a, tap,” sounded on
the door, and Bushy-Tail, the old
squirrel, came limping in. He said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Rap, a, tap,” sounded on the door

<p class='c009'>The Old Woman knew he wanted to
sleep all winter and she thought how
cold his ears would get, so she let him
have money for a brand new night-cap.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Old Woman began to spin so
hard that her spinning wheel went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“Whir, whir, whir!” She had given
away all her fairy gold, and Thanksgiving
was coming nearer and nearer

<p class='c009'>Tinkle Bell came and bought the

The Old Woman thought if she had no

<p class='c009'>“Rap, a, tap,” sounded and in came

<p class='c009'>Now, the Old Woman did not want
to give away all her fairy gold; but her
own eyes were growing dim and she had
to wear spectacles, so she felt sorry for
Foxy-Loxy and let him count out her
gold, and take it all away.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>The Old Woman set the spinning

they showed their new possessions.</p>

<p class='c009'>They all shouted, “We are so thankful!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Tinkle Bell rang the tiny bell on his
cap to bring them to order, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>Those comical little animals jumped

  <h2 class='c005'>Bobby Bright Eyes’ Birthday Party</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Once upon a time Bobby Bright
Eyes was sitting on the door step crying,
when an airy, fairy voice sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I’m the Birthday Fairy flitting by,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bobby Bright Eyes, why do you cry?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Bobby was so surprised he looked
around to see where the voice came
from, but the Fairy was well hidden as
she sang again:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I have secrets more than I ever told,</div>
      <div class='line'>Little Boy, Little Boy, are you five years old?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Bobby Bright Eyes dropped into
verse too, in his excitement and said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“Sing it once more, sing it once more,</div>
      <div class='line'>As yet I am only quarter past four!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then the fairy sailed away.</p>

<p class='c009'>Some time after, Bobby Bright Eyes
sat on the door step looking very sad
for soon he would be five years old, and
he was thinking that he had never had
a Birthday Party in his life.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this very minute a ringing, singing
voice cried out:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I have secrets as well as fairy gold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Little Boy, Little Boy are you five years old?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Bobby Bright Eyes replied:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sing it once more, sing it once more,</div>
      <div class='line'>As yet I am only half past four!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>So time went on, and one day the
Fairy danced in a tree overhead in
plain sight, singing:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>
<img src='images/illus043.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p><i>Bobby Was Sitting on the Doorstep Crying When——</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“I love you so much I am growing bold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Little Boy, Little Boy are you five years old?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Bobby Bright Eyes answered:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I am glad to know you are still alive,</div>
      <div class='line'>To-day I am really quarter of five!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Birthday Fairy knew then that
Bobby Bright Eyes was nearly five
years old, so she kissed him on both
cheeks and followed him about all day
singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Your tasks all wait, so run on after</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll follow you with mirth and laughter.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Bobby had such bright eyes he was
always seeing something to be done,
without being told. So he ran on out
to the barn and gave Pussy Whiskers,
the Cat, a drink of milk.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Birthday Fairy whispered in her ear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Something not meant for us to hear!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Then Bobby ran on to the neighbor
who baked beautiful birthday cakes
and carried a letter for her to the Post
Office, and,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Fairy whispered to her a minute or so</div>
      <div class='line'>Something she did not want us to know!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then Bobby ran errands for the big
fat grocer, and,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Birthday Fairy was very wise,</div>
      <div class='line'>She whispered to the grocer with twinkling eyes!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then Bobby shared an apple with
the boy next door, and,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Birthday Fairy whispered that day</div>
      <div class='line'>Something to him ’ere she ran away.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then Bobby helped a Limpy-Lame
Old Man across the street and,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Birthday Fairy whispered, “Old Man,</div>
      <div class='line'>I hope you will approve my plan.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Now every hour Bobby Bright Eyes
grew nearer and nearer five years old,
and the Birthday Fairy at last said,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I have more secrets than I can hold,</div>
      <div class='line'>Little Boy, Little Boy are you five years old?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>At last Bobby replied, clapping his
hands:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, Birthday Fairy will you stay?</div>
      <div class='line'>For I am five years old to-day.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then the Birthday Fairy danced
right down beside him replying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I’ll stay if you give invitation hearty</div>
      <div class='line'>To your five year old Birthday Party.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>And before Bobby had time to say
he was too poor to have a Birthday
Party, pitter-patter, pitter-patter
came Pussy Whiskers, carrying a small
black kitten in her mouth for a Birthday
present. She purred softly:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“I have been told you are five years old</div>
      <div class='line'>So, I brought you a kitten from my fold.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Bobby Bright Eyes was happy you
may be sure.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, the neighbor who baked beautiful
birthday cakes came saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I have been told you are five years old,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here’s a Birthday cake like some I’ve sold.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It was a wonderful cake with pink
and white icing upon it.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the big fat grocer came puffing
along and cried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I have been told you are five years old,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here are candles that glitter much like gold.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Sure enough, he had five candles to
put on the Birthday cake and when
they were lighted they glittered like
gold.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Then the little boy from next door
ran over and threw a bouncing ball to
Bobby Bright Eyes, saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I have been told you are five years old,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here is a ball to bounce or hold.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Just as they were beginning to play
ball the Limpy-Lame Old Man came,
saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I have been told you are five years old,</div>
      <div class='line'>To present some candy I now make bold.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Birthday Fairy had kept her
secret well, so they all had the merriest
kind of a time, and Bobby Bright Eyes
had a Birthday Party after all. The
Birthday Fairy was the merriest one of
all for she sang as they cut the Birthday
Cake:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A happy Birthday to you dear friend,</div>
      <div class='line'>From beginning to end, from beginning to end.”</div>
    </div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>As he was walking along he chanced
to meet the Croaking Crocodile who
greeted him saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To be happy or sad I can’t decide whether,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Crocodile shed real tears and
the Happy Hare said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We’ll go and seek the Weather Man out,</div>
      <div class='line'>He would like to help us beyond a doubt.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>So, they went on a journey to find
the Weather Man, and they met many
animals as they passed along the
Winding Road for half of a half of a
quarter of a mile.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>They bowed to all the animals they
met and inquired what kind of weather
they wanted.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Said Pussy Whiskers, “I like it dry,</div>
      <div class='line'>Such wet weather makes me want to cry.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Croaking Crocodile said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Join our procession—we’ve a plan,</div>
      <div class='line'>We’re going to the Weather Man.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>So, Pussy Whiskers followed on behind,
but Old Web-Foot the Duck had
heard her remark, and as she thoroughly
enjoyed wet weather she said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Happy Hare skipped on ahead
but the Croaking Crocodile invited Old
Web-Foot to go with them, and they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>went on for half of a half of a quarter
of a mile, until they met Chatter-Box,
the monkey, who said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I’ll join your procession, like as not,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He was glad to go on the journey to
the Weather Man. Next they met
Snowball, the Polar Bear sighing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I come from a cold country as you know,</div>

make a remark</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The Happy Hare said, “I do declare,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Just at this very minute they met a

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Snowball said, “It will be icy like as not.”</div>

<p class='c009'>Pussy Whiskers and Web-Foot and

a circle and tried to get their breath

      <div class='line'>“Ha, ha, we’ll have all the fun we can,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Now, if one ever notices a day half
rain and half sunshine, half hot and

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And if one thinks it worth his while,</div>
      <div class='line'>He can chat with the Croaking Crocodile.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps if one wears Fairy Spectacles,
one can see the Happy Hare
peeping out of his wee little house in
the woods, and one may hear him
singing, as I did once,</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>The Road to Sleepy-Town</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Little Boy Blue went to visit Uncle
Phil on the farm and when night came
he lay all alone in a big bed upstairs.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He was so tired he wanted to weep,</div>
      <div class='line'>But still he could not go to sleep.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He missed his mother’s tucking in
and good night kiss.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>He thought of all the sleepy things
mother had told him to think about.
He tried counting sheep going over a
fence. He hummed a lullaby song,
but his eyes were still wide open when
Fairy Moonlight peeped in and sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hello, little boy in the white night gown,</div>
      <div class='line'>Are you on the road to Sleepy-Town?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Little Boy Blue answered in a sing-song
kind of way:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The harder I try to go to sleep,</div>
      <div class='line'>The wider awake my eyes will peep.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Fairy moonlight danced right into
the room at that, and danced beside
a picture that hung on the wall, as she
sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Some go up, and some go down,</div>
      <div class='line'>On the road to Sleepy-Town.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The picture showed a long road with
houses on each side.</p>

<p><i>Fairy Moonlight Danced Beside a Picture That Hung on a Wall</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Suddenly the most surprising thing
happened!</p>

<p class='c009'>Stars shone out in the sky in the
picture, and began to twinkle, twinkle,
twinkle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lights came out in the windows of
the houses; they began to twinkle,
twinkle, twinkle.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fairy Moonlight said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Little Boy, though I do not know your name,</div>
      <div class='line'>Let us just step over the picture frame.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>No sooner said than done.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were on the road to Sleepy
Town.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Little Boy Blue looked back one
hundred and six children also stepped
over the picture frame and he saw all
his little friends following him.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>There was Betty with her new doll
snuggled up close and Bobby with his
Teddy Bear, Little Mary came drawing
her cart behind her.</p>

<p class='c009'>A sleepy old man was lighting lamps
all along the road singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Right foot, left foot up and down,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus we march to Sleepy-Town.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>They saw a sleepy old wind-mill
turning round and round, round and
round, and the wind-mill sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Here they come with smiles and frown,</div>
      <div class='line'>On the road to Sleepy-Town.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>At that very minute Betty sat down
and fell asleep under the wind-mill.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the rest of the children trooped
on. They could see the lights of
Sleepy-Town twinkle, twinkle, twinkle
in the distance.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>They heard the sleepy little birds
twittering in the trees.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Here comes a boy much like a clown,</div>
      <div class='line'>He often visits Sleepy-Town.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>At that very minute Billy sat down
under the trees and fell asleep, while
the other children went hurrying on.</p>

<p class='c009'>They passed by a sleepy little brook
that went singing over the stones:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hurrah, hurrah for your little night gown,</div>
      <div class='line'>You’ll need it soon in Sleepy-Town.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>At that, all the children but Little
Boy Blue sat down and began to throw
pebbles into the brook and soon their
heads went nid-nid nodding and they
were fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fairy Moonlight sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The hours come, the hours go,</div>
      <div class='line'>The Sandman’s rocking to and fro.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Sure enough, there was the sleepy
old Sandman rocking to and fro in a
hammock.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/illus063.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p><i>So He Fell Asleep</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Little Boy Blue was so tired he crept
in beside him and so he fell asleep right
there on the road to Sleepy-Town.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>The lights went out in the streets
and houses one by one, and every one
went nid-nid nodding.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,” rang a bell
and Little Boy Blue looked about. The
Sandman was gone. Fairy Sunshine
cried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You wake up happy now, it seems</div>
      <div class='line'>You came back from the land of dreams!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Little Boy Blue woke up sure enough
in the great big bed, and soon he ran
down stairs with a hop and skip and
bound.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Phil said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Good morning, how fast you did come down.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Little Boy Blue replied:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I just got back from Sleepy-Town.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>The most surprising part of the most
surprising part of the story is still to
come.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Uncle Phil took Boy Blue
home that evening in the old buggy he
put a mysterious box with a mysterious
paper and string covering it, into
the old buggy.</p>

<p class='c009'>When they arrived he handed Boy
Blue the box.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the box were little paper houses,
and little paper street lamps, and windmills,
and trees, and under one tree
was a hammock for the Sandman.</p>

<p class='c009'>It took Boy Blue exactly one hour to
set the little town up, and Uncle Phil
attached a cord and Boy Blue cried
out with delight as from every house
and every street lamp there shone a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>light that twinkled, twinkled,
twinkled.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Phil said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You’re a good little boy with never a frown,</div>
      <div class='line'>And so I bought you this Sleepy-Town.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Boy Blue thanked Uncle Phil and
had many happy hours playing with
his new toy town.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fairy Moonlight peeped in the window
and sang as she watched Boy Blue
at play:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Every child in his little gown</div>
      <div class='line'>Is on the road to Sleepy-Town.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Her voice was so sleepy, sleepy,
sleepy as she sang that even Uncle Phil,
who was telling this story, fell asleep,
and</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>All the fairies looking down</div>

  <h2 class='c005'>Old Mother Bear’s Christmas Stocking</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Old Mother Bear sat in her red rocking
chair knitting and singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Click, click, click, I must hurry because</div>
      <div class='line'>Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, comes Santa Claus.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>She was finishing a stocking to hang
up by the chimney for Santa Claus
to fill.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this very minute she heard, “Rap,
a, tap” on the door and she sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Click, click, click, who comes here?</div>

<p><i>Old Shaggy Brother</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In came Charlie Chatter-Box, the
monkey, saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I am Charlie Chatter-Box—sad because,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ve no stocking to hang up for Santa Claus.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>He wiped his eyes on his 5 cent
pocket handkerchief and Old Mother
Bear felt so sorry for him, she finished
the stocking she was knitting in a
hurry, and gave it to him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Charlie Chatter-Box thanked her
and went off saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“Merry Christmas comes in song and rhyme,</div>
      <div class='line'>Old Mother Bear may you have a good time.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Old Mother Bear was a wonderful
knitter, and soon she had another
stocking nearly finished. She sang as
before:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Click, click, click, I must hurry because,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, comes Santa Claus.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then a light foot-fall was heard outside.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>On the window-pane she heard such a clatter,</div>
      <div class='line'>She got right up to see what was the matter!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Old Shaggy Brother, the tramp dog,
stood there saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Santa Claus comes as I remember,</div>
      <div class='line'>May I warm my paws in old December?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Old Mother Bear let him in of course,
and as he sat and warmed his paws
by the fire, he said in a mournful way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>that he had no stocking to hang up
for Santa Claus, and he cried into his
10 cent pocket handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c009'>Old Mother Bear’s needles clicked
faster and faster and soon she had a
stocking ready for Old Shaggy Brother.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went dancing off saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I wish you a Merry Christmas I do declare,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Old Mother Bear set up another
stocking and began to knit faster and
faster, singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Click, click, click, I must hurry because,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Ting, a, ling,” rang the telephone
and Sister Pussy Whiskers called:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hello, hello, Old Mother Bear,</div>
      <div class='line'>I am very sad I do declare,</div>
      <div class='line'>It may be hard for you to believe,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ve no stocking to hang up on Christmas Eve.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Old Mother Bear could hear her
weeping into her new 25 cent pocket
handkerchief, so she said she would
mail her a stocking to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sister Pussy Whiskers shouted,
“Merry Christmas!” and Old Mother
Bear went back to her knitting, singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“I’ll set up a new stocking as sure as fate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Santa Claus comes, I must not be late.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then, as she worked away busily
she heard a great roaring and crying
outside and a voice said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hear the Mad March Hare roaring out of season,</div>
      <div class='line'>I need a stocking, that is the reason!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Old Mother Bear opened the door
and invited the Mad March Hare
in. He ran wildly about the room and
tangled up her yarn and it was one
hour and thirty-two minutes before
Old Mother Bear could get him to sit
down and dry his fur and whiskers.</p>

<p class='c009'>He said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I am roaring this way because,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ve no stocking to hang up for Santa Claus.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Old Mother Bear said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Just calm yourself and with me stay,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll give you this stocking in a week and a day.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Mad March Hare was happy
to stay in the warm house and he did
all the house work, while Old Mother
Bear’s needles clicked away.</p>

<p class='c009'>He made a furious dust when he
swept the floor and broke a good many
dishes but he said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You must not really think me bad,</div>
      <div class='line'>It is just my nature to be mad.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>When at last he went off with his
stocking Old Mother Bear drew a sigh
of relief. He called back to her:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I hope Old Santa will fill <i>your</i> stocking too,</div>
      <div class='line'>Merry, Merry Christmas, Mother Bear, to you.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Then suddenly, and without any
warning whatever Cousin Nanny Goat
and Sammy Small Tail the Rabbit,
came bounding in crying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We’ve no stockings to hang by the fireside</div>
      <div class='line'>For miles we ran and cried, and cried!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Old Mother Bear replied:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Do dry your eyes, oh dear, oh dear,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ve a pair of stockings left from last year.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then Cousin Nanny Goat dried her
eyes on her blue silk pocket handkerchief
and Sammy Small Tail dried his
eyes on his red silk pocket handkerchief,
and they watched Old Mother
Bear go to a chest and draw out a
pair of stockings!</p>

<p class='c009'>As she gave them to those cunning
animals they shouted:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“You’re so good we’ll not shed another tear,</div>
      <div class='line'>We wish you Merry Christmas every year.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>As they danced off with their stockings,
it grew near and nearer, Christmas
Eve.</p>

<p class='c009'>One evening as Sammy Small Tail
hopped by Old Mother Bear’s house
he peeped in the window. There she
sat still in her red rocking chair. The
knitting needles lay idle on the window-sill
but they could see things with
their eyes. They said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“She will have no presents now because,</div>
      <div class='line'>She has no stocking to hang up, for Santa Claus.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Now, Sammy Small Tail went off
in a hurry when he heard this, saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hippety-hop, I have the habit,</div>
      <div class='line'>Of carrying news, says Sammy Rabbit.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>He called all the animals together
and said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I have some news, it’s rather shocking,</div>
      <div class='line'>Old Mother Bear hangs up no stocking!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The animals asked:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Why doesn’t she hang it up this year</div>
      <div class='line'>For Santa Claus will soon appear.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Sammy Small Tail replied:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Click, click, click, the needles say,</div>
      <div class='line'>She gave every stocking she had, away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>One and all the animals went to
work and made a stocking three feet
long, and one foot wide! They made
it for Old Mother Bear!</p>

<p class='c009'>Charley Chatter-Box put in a cocoanut
and Old Shaggy Brother put in
an orange and Sister Pussy Whiskers
put in an apple and Cousin Nanny
Goat put in a plum, and the Mad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>March Hare put in a new cup and
saucer, and Sammy Small Tail put in
a cookie.</p>

<p class='c009'>They crept to Old Mother Bear’s
House and crept to the window and
stole in silently, and hung up the stocking.</p>

<p class='c009'>They pinned a card on it, which said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“One good turn deserves another,</div>
      <div class='line'>Here is a stocking for Old Bear Mother.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Old Mother Bear by and by began
to rock to and fro, half awake, singing
sleepily:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Click, click, click, I must hurry because,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, comes Santa Claus.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Sure enough, Santa Claus was on
his way.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, went his sleigh
bells.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>He filled all the animals’ stockings
and when he came to the house of Old
Mother Bear and saw her big stocking
he laughed until his sides shook, saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“It’s a great big stocking I do declare,</div>
      <div class='line'>How can I fill it for Old Mother Bear?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then Old Mother Bear woke up and
she and Santa Claus danced a hornpipe,
and for all I know they are dancing
yet:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>They must have had a merry time because,</div>
      <div class='line'>When up the chimney went Santa Claus,</div>
      <div class='line'>He wore new red socks I do declare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Carefully knit by Old Mother Bear!</div>

  <h2 class='c005'>Old Mother Bear’s Happy New Year</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Old Mother Bear sat in the chimney
corner one New Year’s Eve sighing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I have four naughty Bears, oh dear,</div>
      <div class='line'>How can I have a Happy New Year?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Lady Wind peeped in a crack under
the window and said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The night is bright, the stars are clear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Old Mother Bear, Happy New Year!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Old Mother Bear shook her head
sighing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“It sounds very sad in song and rhyme,</div>
      <div class='line'>My Boxer is never in school on time.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Old Mother Moon peeped in the
window next singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“I wonder if my voice you’ll hear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Old Mother Bear, Happy New Year.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Old Mother Bear shook her right
paw and said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I have my troubles, Drowsy-Head</div>
      <div class='line'>Never wants to go to bed.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then a snowflake Fairy called:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“January is drawing near,</div>
      <div class='line'>Old Mother Bear, Happy New Year.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Old Mother Bear answered:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“It is very well for you to sing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Bruin never picks up anything!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then Fairy See-It-All came bouncing
into the room shouting:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There’s something wrong inside I fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Old Mother Bear, Happy New Year.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Old Mother Bear replied:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Bright Eyes does not mean to tease,</div>
      <div class='line'>But never says, ‘Thank you, or if you please’.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Old Mother Bear began to growl,
and growl, and growl, and finally she
said, “How can I have a Happy New
Year when Boxer is always late to
school, and Drowsy-Head never wants
to go to bed, and Bruin leaves his
things around, and Bright Eyes is always
impolite?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Fairy See-It-All had a wee little carriage
that ran by itself, and in the
twinkling of an eye she tucked in those
four naughty little Bears and they rode
away, away, away until they came to
a wee little house in the woods on New
Year’s Eve.</p>

<p class='c009'>She said to Boxer:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You can’t get out however you climb,</div>
      <div class='line'>Unless you learn to be on time.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Then for one whole year Boxer had
to practice being on time to breakfast,
dinner and supper, and he said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“On time to-day, on time to-morrow</div>
      <div class='line'>On time, will save me from my sorrow.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>So, he stayed in the wee little house
in the woods a whole year and learned
to be on time.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fairy See-It-All said to Drowsy-Head:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You must learn to like to go to bed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dear little, queer little Drowsy-Head.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then Drowsy-Head had to practice
doing useful things in the wee little
house a whole year until he was tired
enough to go to bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fairy See-It-All said to Bruin:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You’ll never get out of here I’ll be bound,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Till you pick up things you’ve left around.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>All day long and every day for a
whole year Bruin had to pick up his
things and the belongings of the other
Bears.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fairy See-It-All said to Bright Eyes:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You’ll have to practice words like these,</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Thank you, thank you, and if you please’.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Of course after that Bright Eyes
tried to be polite.</p>

<p class='c009'>Every night the four little Bears flattened
their noses against the window
panes and cried out:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We are four little Bears, who don’t like to roam,</div>
      <div class='line'>We want Mother Bear, we want to go home.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Lady Wind blew around the wee
house and Mother Moon peeped in
the window, the Snowflake Fairy danced
lightly down and at last, a year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>later, on New Year’s Eve, Fairy See-It-All
brought her carriage that ran
by itself, and tucked the four little
Bears safely inside and away, away,
away, they rode homeward.</p>

<p class='c009'>They all were happy as happy could
be, shouting:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We’ve learned our lessons never fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Old Mother Bear, Happy New Year.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Old Mother Bear was happy, for
Boxer had learned to be on time, and
was always on time at school, and
Drowsy-Head liked to go to bed,
and Bruin picked up his clothes and
toys and Bright Eyes said, “Thank
you,” and “If you please.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After some children had read this
story 99 times <i>the most surprising
things happened</i>!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>One little boy got to school every
day for a whole year on time, so his
teacher had a Happy New Year. One
little girl went happily to bed every
night, so one mother had a Happy
New Year, and one little boy began
to pick up his toys, so one father had
a Happy New Year.</p>

<p class='c009'>So many children learned to say
“Thank you” and “If you please,”
that people everywhere in town smiled
and shook hands on the street when
they met, and called, “A Happy New
Year, A Happy New Year.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>Little Tommy Tittlemouse</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Little Tommy Tittlemouse sat by
the fire one evening saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Three times seven, I cannot see</div>
      <div class='line'>Why you always puzzle me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>As he looked into the grate he saw
a red flame curl up, and up, and soon
a Funny Fairy dressed in red and white
jumped up on one of the logs and
cried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You’re never going to pass your grade,</div>
      <div class='line'>If you keep on like this, I am afraid.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Tommy was just going to answer
when the Funny Fairy jumped out of
the fire and called:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“Number Fairy bright and airy,</div>
      <div class='line'>By fire-light, come out to-night.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then, the Number Fairy came
whisk! bound, out of the fire. She
wore a black dress with white numbers
upon it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The numbers they went from her head to her toes</div>
      <div class='line'>She was very learned as you may well suppose.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>She shook her finger at Tommy and
cried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To learn the three’s you’re surely able,</div>
      <div class='line'>Come and recite the entire table.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Tommy stood on one foot and then
on the other, and could not get farther
than “three times four,” to save his
life.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>The Funny Fairy felt sorry for him
so he cried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

      <div class='line'>“Reader Fairy, bright and airy,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Reader Fairy came out with a
hop, skip and bound. She had words
printed all over her coat. She bowed
to Tommy and said of him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“This little mortal reads like a fairy,</div>
      <div class='line'>He can even read a dictionary.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Tommy was pleased you may be
sure, for he was the best reader in his
class.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Funny Fairy called next:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Writing Fairy, bright and airy,</div>
      <div class='line'>By fire-light, come out to-night.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Writing Fairy came out with
letters all over him, whistling and singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>“He has the neatest copy-book,</div>
      <div class='line'>In the school-room, come and look.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Tommy knew that he did write neatly.
The Funny Fairy said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Be it fancy, fact, or fable,</div>
      <div class='line'>He must really learn his table.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then the most surprising thing happened.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Number Fairy took his hand
and ran with him out of the house,
away, away, away, to Number Land.</p>

<p class='c009'>They met funny little Fairies everywhere
with numbers all over them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Four little Number Fairies offered
him the cutest cookies with sugar upon
them saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Two cakes and two cakes, answer quick,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ho, ho, do you know your arithmetic?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Tommy shook his head and passed
sadly by the cakes, but in a minute the
Number Fairies offered him bananas,
saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Three times seven is quite a trick,</div>
      <div class='line'>Can you do it by arithmetic?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Tommy could not answer, so they
went hurrying by.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next he was offered some rosy red
apples and the Fairies said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Why can’t you answer up this season,</div>
      <div class='line'>Will you really tell the reason?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Tommy replied:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I really never do seem able,</div>
      <div class='line'>To get on with the ‘three times’ table.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then the Number Fairies set up a
shout and cried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“This little boy would like to please,</div>
      <div class='line'>So we will help him count by 3’s.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>The Fairies jumped about and formed
a ring round him, shouting:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Three, six, nine,</div>
      <div class='line'>That is fine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Twelve, fifteen, eighteen,</div>
      <div class='line'>Time to be unseen!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then they began to sing the table to
a little fairy tune and Tommy joined
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, the most wonderful part of
the most wonderful part of the story
is yet to come.</p>

<p class='c009'>In rolled a big, round table, and
three times three chairs.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fairies and Tommy sat down.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the center of a table was a wee
fairy, with a figure three on her cap.
She waved her wand at each Fairy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>and Tommy in turn, and called for,
“3 times 3” and “3 times 6” and “3
times 11.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Each time when any one answered
correctly, down floated a plate of Fairy
food smoking hot.</p>

<p class='c009'>To the surprise of all, Tommy cried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Three times seven is twenty-one,</div>
      <div class='line'>Really I do call this <i>fun</i>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Just as he was putting his fork into
his plate a great cry arose.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Your table now you understand,</div>
      <div class='line'>But you cannot <i>eat</i> in Fairyland!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In less than a twinkling of an eye
he was whisked back home, and was
sitting by the fire, but the Funny Fairy
sat beside him, saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If you had tasted Fairy food,</div>
      <div class='line'>To come back home you never could,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>To learn your numbers you are able,</div>
      <div class='line'>By aid of a little Fairy table.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then the Funny Fairy cut out many
circles, and put a number in the center
of each one. He put numbers all
round the circles, too. Whenever
Tommy multiplied any number in the
outside of the circle by the number in
the center, down on the circle floated
a plate of fairy food, but he was never
quick enough to catch it to eat.</p>

<p class='c009'>He said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The tables seem so real to me,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll learn more quickly now you see.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>By and by he fell asleep by the fire,
and the Funny Fairy went back into
the grate and sat on a log singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To study now he’s learned the trick,</div>
      <div class='line'>He’ll soon be bright in arithmetic.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>Next day Tommy knew the
“threes,” and soon he learned all the
tables. He said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I love funny things and fables,</div>
      <div class='line'>I learned numbers by fairy tables.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Funny Fairy seemed to be
around often. He sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If you’re in earnest in what you’re about</div>
      <div class='line'>The fairies will often help you out.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Tommy tried to find the Fairy, but
he had vanished.</p>

March when the stormy winds were
blowing.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went hoppety-hop to his little
wee house in the woods. He roared so
loudly as he went about his house-keeping
and broke so many dishes as
he washed his cups and saucers, that
Old Hug-Me-Tight, the Bear, pricked
up his ears as he passed by, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>The Mad March Hare stuck his
head out the kitchen window and
called:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Old Hug-Me-Tight, come in, come in,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Bear was happy to come in and
dry his wet paws by the kitchen fire.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fire roared up the chimney.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tea kettle sang and the Mad
March Hare kept dropping dishes,
clitter, clatter, smash, crash on the
floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Bear said:</p>

</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>The Mad March Hare gave a wild

ears, replying:</p>

      <div class='line'>“Why do you take a winter nap,</div>

<p class='c009'>Old Hug-Me-Tight, the Bear, hung
his head for sure enough, he did sleep
all winter!</p>

<p class='c009'>At this very minute Big Brother
Beaver came lopping along. He
heard such a noise in the house of the
Mad March Hare that he tapped politely
at the door and inquired:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Why are you building night and day,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>The Beaver did not know what to
say to that for it was his nature to
build, but he came in and warmed his
paws by the fire and dried his coat,
for it was a misty, moist morning.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Mad March Hare went on washing
dishes and breaking handles off
his cups, and dropping knives and
forks.</p>

<p class='c009'>He peeped out the window and saw
Chatter-Box, the monkey, swinging on
the tree outside. He called:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Monkey danced and pranced
about and helped the Mad March
Hare finish his dish-washing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, suddenly, without any warning
the Mad March Hare said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“’Tis well to keep secrets without a doubt</div>
      <div class='line'>You may wonder what I am mad about.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Beaver put on his horn-rimmed
spectacles and tried to see what the
reason could be.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Monkey put his paw up to his
ear to listen.</p>

<p class='c009'>All the time the March wind howled
louder, and louder, and the rain fell,
and the sleet came, but the kitchen
fire roared merrily and the tea kettle
sang a cheerful song.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>The Mad March Hare said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Mary is mad when they comb her hair,</div>

<p>“<i>Mary is mad when they comb her hair</i>”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Bear, the Beaver and the Monkey
nodded their heads. They had
seen Mary mad many times when her
hair was combed.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>The Mad March Hare continued:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Jack is mad to be bathed I fear,</div>
      <div class='line'>He cried so loud that the neighbors hear.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then those comical animals clapped
their paws, and told of one hundred
and nine children who got mad every
day over one thing or another!</p>

<p class='c009'>The Mad March Hare said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I gather up their scowls and tears,</div>
      <div class='line'>No wonder I am mad, my dears,</div>
      <div class='line'>They’re mad to-day and mad to-morrow,</div>
      <div class='line'>So they bring to me much sorrow,</div>
      <div class='line'>They are not bad, they just get mad,</div>
      <div class='line'>And so they make the March Hare sad.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>For one hour and sixteen minutes
they sat warm and dry about the cheerful
fire. Suddenly, Hug-Me-Tight began
to hug them all in turn, and Big
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Brother Beaver and Chatter-Box
danced a hornpipe and they all shouted:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We’ll put it in story, and put it in song,</div>
      <div class='line'>The whole world will read about it ere long.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>So, those comical little animals
wrote a story and a song, asking the
children not to get mad any more, so
the March Hare could be happy.</p>

<p class='c009'>Chatter-Box drew a picture of the
Hare that all children love, and they
all sang the song they composed to
the tune of “Twinkle Little Star.”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Soon the visitors had to go home.</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>“I’ll sing for the children if I dare,</div>
      <div class='line'>Good bye, good bye, dear Mad March Hare.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Mad March Hare grew as happy
as happy could be, and waved his
hat as his visitors ran homeward.
He called after them:</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We don’t mind the Mad March weather,</div>
      <div class='line'>We had such a happy time together.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>So many children learned the song
about the Mad March Hare, and so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>many children enjoyed the story that
all over the world they whistled and
sang instead of getting angry.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Mad March Hare whistled and
sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I am happy—as happy could be,</div>

</div>

<p class='c009'>So, he did not get out in time to
see the Circus Parade, and when he got
to the Circus Tent he was too late.
Crowds were turned away.</p>

<p class='c009'>He went back home and sat down
on the wood pile, and was feeling very
sad when to his surprise, a merry voice
called:</p>

<p class='c009'>There, sure enough, stood a regular
Clown on his head, beside him!</p>

<p class='c009'>Danny-Do-Little was so surprised
he did not know what to say, and
waited until the Clown stood on his
feet, then he remarked:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“If you’re a Clown from Circus Town,</div>
      <div class='line'>How did you get here in striped gown?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Clown answered in a sing-song
Clownish way:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I’m such a joker I might explain,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then he went through the funniest
little dance and danced so hard that
he kicked off one of his silver slippers!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Danny-Do-Little clapped his hands
and begged him to come in-doors and
perform some of his tricks.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Clown was as thirsty as thirsty
could be so he said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Danny-Do-Little, did you fail,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Danny-Do-Little laughed and ran
to the pump and filled the water pail
in a hurry to please the Clown.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the Clown surprised him!</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>He took a drink of water you know,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then at exactly that minute, the
Clown began to want a cup of tea. He
wanted it so badly he could hardly
wait, but there was no fire and he
shouted:</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Danny-Do-Little took the hint at
once, and he ran out and got an armful
of wood, and made a fire and put
on the tea-pot, and soon the water was
boiling merrily for a cup of tea.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>What did the Clown do, do you suppose?</div>
      <div class='line'>He balanced the tea cup on his nose!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Every time he did a trick Danny-Do-Little
tried to do the same, and
together, they burst into merry peals
of laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Clown was hungry and he dearly
loved hard boiled eggs so he shouted:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Danny-Do-Little is it best</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Danny-Do-Little could take a suggestion
as well as any boy, so he ran
and got a basket full of eggs from the
chicken house.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When in from the barn with eggs he came,</div>

<p class='c009'>Then the Clown threw eggs in the
air and caught them.</p>

<p class='c009'>All of a sudden he looked at the
kitchen floor.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There was so much dust upon the floor,</div>
      <div class='line'>He had never seen the like before!</div>
      <div class='line'>At Danny he cast a side-long glance,</div>
      <div class='line'>He took the broom and performed a dance!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>When the floor was quite clean, out
from his pocket he took a wonderful
red bouncing ball and performed all
kinds of tricks with it.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>He shouted:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Danny-Do-Little does nothing at all,</div>
      <div class='line'>He is too lazy to even play ball!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Try me and see,” cried Danny, and
the Clown played ball with him and
showed him one hundred and six ways
of doing tricks with the wonderful red
bouncing ball. Then he put up his
hand, saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“See that finger aside my nose?</div>
      <div class='line'>It’s time I were going goodness knows.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Danny-Do-Little begged the Clown
to stay but he gave him two tickets
to the Circus which was to be held next
week in On-Time-Town. He said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I’m very glad you admire my gown,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m off and away to On-Time-Town.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Danny-Do-Little was amused for he
had not said a single word about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Clown’s suit, but he was so sorry to
see him go that he looked rather sad,
but the Clown tossed him his wonderful
red bouncing ball and cried:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Practice your tricks, don’t stop to sigh,</div>
      <div class='line'>I’ll meet you again, good bye, good bye.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then Danny-Do-Little began to
practice all the tricks in real earnest
and found his little feet began to act
as though they belonged to him, and
his arms and legs began to limber up
and soon he was as active as could be.
He learned to do many tricks well, but
those he did with the bouncing ball
were best of all.</p>

<p class='c009'>Surprising things began to happen!</p>

<p class='c009'>All the boys came to learn his tricks
and hear the story of the Circus Clown!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>The water pail was always full.</p>

<p class='c009'>The wood-box was never empty!</p>

<p class='c009'>The eggs were gathered every day!</p>

<p class='c009'>Danny-Do-Little was busy from
morning until night.</p>

<p class='c009'>One day the greatest surprise of all
came through the mail. There was
a red and white box addressed to
“Danny-Do-It-Now,” once called,
“Danny-Do-Little.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In the red and white box was a red
and white Clown suit just his size.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the suit was a red and white
card saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Little Danny Do-It-Now,</div>
      <div class='line'>You learned your tricks, please tell me how,</div>
      <div class='line'>You’re a bright boy as every one knows,</div>
      <div class='line'>Please accept this gift from Silver Toes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>What happened next do you suppose?</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

  <h2 class='c005'>Jack and Jill’s Tooth-Pick Circus</h2>
</div>

<p class='c008'>One day Jack and Jill had the
mumps and could not go to the circus.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Phil came in whistling and
he said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I’ve brought you something sure to please,</div>
      <div class='line'>You can <i>make</i> a circus with sticks and peas.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>To their delight he showed them
how.</p>

<p class='c009'>They soaked the peas and stuck the
tooth picks in them so they would hold
together.</p>

<p class='c009'>They made the circus tent and side-show
tents, cages for the animals, and
a merry-go-round.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>It was fun to make the Tooth-Pick
Animals and Clown.</p>

<p class='c009'>Uncle Phil said he must go to work,
but he said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Jack and Jill, good bye, good bye,</div>
      <div class='line'>You can be happy if you try.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>So saying, he went off and then the
most extraordinary thing happened.</p>

<p class='c009'>A voice whispered:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The animals are in the tent,</div>
      <div class='line'>And each one is on mischief bent,</div>
      <div class='line'>The tent flap soon will open wide,</div>
      <div class='line'>There’s room for you and me inside!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Jack and Jill clapped their hands
and said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We wish we were little girl and boy</div>
      <div class='line'>As <i>tiny</i> as each Tooth-Pick toy.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>They did not know they were sitting
on a wishing rug.</p>

<p class='c009'>No sooner had they made their wish
than they grew smaller, and smaller,
and smaller, and went inside the very
tent they had made.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this exciting minute a voice said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And now we see the circus ring,</div>
      <div class='line'>Round which the old clowns dance and sing,</div>
      <div class='line'>The animals will march two and two,</div>
      <div class='line'>And make a little show for you.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, oh,” cried Jack and Jill.
“What if our Tooth-Pick Clown and
animals should become alive?”</p>

<p class='c009'>In came the Tooth-Pick Clowns,
singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Tooth-Pick Clowns walk two and two,</div>
      <div class='line'>And funny things they say to you,</div>
      <div class='line'>Skipping lightly round the ring,</div>
      <div class='line'>They crack their whips and laugh and sing.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Then in came a rider with a chariot
saying:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The golden chariot you know,</div>
      <div class='line'>Has a rider bowing low,</div>
      <div class='line'>The circus is a pleasant place,</div>
      <div class='line'>To behold a chariot race.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Then in came the comical little animals
and did their tricks in the rings.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Clown sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“This lion’s of uncertain age,</div>
      <div class='line'>Perhaps you like him in his cage,</div>
      <div class='line'>Round the circus ring he’ll go,</div>
      <div class='line'>He’s trained to act so in the show.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In came the tall Giraffe and the
Clown sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We introduce the tall Giraffe,</div>
      <div class='line'>And beg that you will never laugh.</div>
      <div class='line'>At his tall neck or anything,</div>
      <div class='line'>As he marches in the ring!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Next, in came an old Elephant, and
the Clown riding on his back said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“See the old trick Elephant,</div>
      <div class='line'>He likes to live out in a tent,</div>
      <div class='line'>He’s a traveller as every one knows,</div>
      <div class='line'>And carries his trunk wherever he goes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Jack and Jill had so much fun they
even rode in the merry-go-round and
sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The Merry-Go-Round is quite a treat</div>
      <div class='line'>If you have money for a seat.</div>
      <div class='line'>Round and round the horses go,</div>
      <div class='line'>To music playing sweet and low.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>By and by the wonderful circus was
over and the Clowns called:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The big band wagon now will pass,</div>
      <div class='line'>Too soon it’s out of sight, alas!</div>
      <div class='line'>We wish the band could play always,</div>
      <div class='line'>It makes such happy circus days!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Jack and Jill went into a side-show
tent to have their fortunes told. Outside
the tent the sign read:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“This is a little side-show tent,</div>
      <div class='line'>From which come peals of merriment,</div>
      <div class='line'>If you’ve a dime step in and see,</div>
      <div class='line'>What it holds of mystery.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Jack and Jill went merrily homeward
while the old Clowns called after
them:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The children travel two and two,</div>
      <div class='line'>For many have to walk ’tis true,</div>
      <div class='line'>They like to imitate the Clown,</div>
      <div class='line'>When the circus comes to town.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Family Clock greeted them as
they got home. It began to strike
and sing in a comical manner:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hear me count, one, two, three, four, five.</div>
      <div class='line'>I’m glad that you got home alive,</div>
      <div class='line'>Perhaps it takes you by surprise,</div>
      <div class='line'>But now you are the proper size!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Jack and Jill rubbed their sleepy
eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were in their own little red
rocking chairs at home. They still
had the mumps of course for company!</p>

<p class='c009'>There, on the table before them, were
the Tooth-Pick Animals, there were the
merry Clowns, and the tent stood with
a flap open so one could go inside!</p>

<p class='c009'>The children said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“How very funny it does seem,</div>
      <div class='line'>We both had such a jolly dream.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>At this very minute, in came Uncle
Phil with both hands behind his back,
singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Which hand will you choose? I’ve pleasant news,</div>
      <div class='line'>It is sure to drive away the blues,</div>
      <div class='line'>As I came walking back to town</div>
      <div class='line'>I met a friend, a Circus Clown!”</div>

<p class='c009'>Jack got a bag of pop corn and Jill
a bag of peanuts.</p>

<p class='c009'>Behind Uncle Phil came a really,

Circus gown of red and white. He
had a red and white striped cap on,
and his face was painted many colors!</p>

<p class='c009'>He stood on his head and turned

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
